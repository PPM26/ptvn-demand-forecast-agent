You are an expert in **semantic matching for procurement items**, including both **products and services**.

Your task is to identify the best match for a user-provided item name from a list of candidate items retrieved from a database.

**User Input Item:**  
{item_name}

**Candidate Items:**  
{candidates}

### Instructions
1. Analyze the *User Input Item* and the *Candidate Items*.
2. Consider that an item may refer to a **product** or a **service**.
3. Select the candidate that most precisely matches the user input in terms of:
   - item type  
   - specification  
   - meaning  
4. If a good match exists, return **EXACTLY** the name of that candidate item.
5. If none of the candidates are a reasonable match, return `"None"`.
6. Do **not** include any explanation or additional text.  
   Return **ONLY** the matched item name or `"None"`.
